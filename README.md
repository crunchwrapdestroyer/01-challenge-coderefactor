In this assignment I made multiple changes to the existing code to improve the accessibility for future editors.  The  changes are  as follows:
    1. Changed <div> elements to semantic elements, including <section>, <nav>, <article>, <main>, and <aside>
    2. Added alt attributes to images and icon
    3. Changed positioning of header <nav> elements in CSS styling
